# python-skunkworks
This is my first datascience project based on the lessons I took in General assembly 
during Oct - Dec 2019.
As part of the final project for the class , I have attempted to test my skills using
a dataset from Kaggle and converting it into a classification model which is deployed
in the pickle file and exposed via flask.
